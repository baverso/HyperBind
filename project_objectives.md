# HyperBind Project Objectives

The goal of the HyperBind project is to develop a state-of-the-art contrastive learning pipeline for antibody binding prediction using advanced embedding models, sophisticated data processing techniques, and rigorous validation against both synthetic and real-world data. The following objectives outline the key milestones for the project:

1. **Develop Custom Embeddings Using ESM-Fold and ESM-3**  
   - Create an embedding model for proteins based on ESM-3.  
   - Develop a fine-tuned embedding model for antibodies using ESM-Fold.

2. **Develop Data Methods**  
   - Implement robust data ingestion methods to support train/validation/test splits.  
   - Design and implement techniques to address data imbalance issues in laboratory data.  
   - Build tools for generating synthetic negative examples to enrich the dataset.

3. **Construct Datasets for Negative Dataset Parameter Tuning**  
   - Create multiple datasets specifically designed to explore and optimize negative dataset parameters.

4. **Develop HyperBind Architecture and Train on Synthetic Data**  
   - Design the HyperBind deep learning architecture.  
   - Train the model on synthetic data to establish a proof-of-concept.

5. **Validate HyperBind Performance on a Simplified World of Antibody Binding**  
   - Use synthetic Absolut data to benchmark and refine model performance.

6. **Validate HyperBind on Real-World, Data-Rich Targets**  
   - Test and validate the model on datasets related to HIV, SARS-CoV-2, or other targets with abundant data.

7. **Benchmark HyperBind Against Published Methods**  
   - Compare the performance of HyperBind with other state-of-the-art methods in antibody binding prediction.
